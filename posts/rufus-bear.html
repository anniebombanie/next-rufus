<p>This bear was given to him by his neighbours and he loves to take naps with it. Sometimes he'll carry his bear in his mouth with him around the apartment, and they'll watch the snowfall out of the window together. Other times, Rufus likes to drown his bear in the toilet.</p>
<p>One time, I found his bear in the toilet and I yelled his name. Rufus ran over to me when I did this. He stood up on his hind legs to look down at the bear. Then in front of my eyes, he put one paw in the toilet and proceeded to push his bear under the water. Over and over again. üòë</p>
